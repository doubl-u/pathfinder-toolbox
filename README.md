# pathfinder-toolbox
A JavaScript toolkit for testing and comparing pathfinding algorithms on a configurable grid. Supports randomized trials, dynamic obstacle placement, and performance tracking (success rates, step counts, and efficiency metrics). Includes visualization for methods like random walks and Dijkstra's algorithm, with options for adding custom strategies
